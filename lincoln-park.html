            <blockquote>
                “Within Lincoln Park’s lawns, sculptures, and tree-lined allée live stories of Native American presence,
                Civil War remembrance, public health reform, immigration, and the city’s recovery after the Great
                Chicago Fire.”
                <br>—Kristin N. Smith, producer of Forged in History: Lincoln Park, Shaping Chicago.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Second only to New York’s Central Park as the most visited urban park in the United States, Lincoln Park
                today spans more than 1,200 acres. What began as a 19th-century public cemetery has evolved into a
                living archive of Chicago’s civic past. Zoogoers, joggers, picnickers, and international visitors pass
                statues of long-departed figures with only a glance, but filmmaker Kristin N. Smith wants to change
                that.</p>

            <p>Phase One included fall filming, with professional cinematographers capturing visuals of Lincoln Park
                that reveal both its history and artistic design. The documentary will explore overlooked narratives
                embedded in the park’s landscape and monuments, histories that quietly trace Chicago’s formative
                chapters.</p>

            <p>Smith previously produced David Adler: Great House Architect, which aired nationally on PBS for three
                years. She is donating her time and expertise to this project as part of her broader work preserving and
                interpreting historic and cultural heritage.</p>

            <div class="article-image">
                <img src="lincoln-statue.jpg" alt="Lincoln Statue">
                <div class="image-caption">Statue of Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln Park.</div>
            </div>

            <p>“When the meaning of a place is understood, it’s more likely to be protected,” Smith said. “This film
                aims to reconnect people with the stories that give Lincoln Park its enduring civic value.”</p>

            <p>For Smith, documenting Lincoln Park now feels particularly urgent. “At a time when urban development
                increasingly produces interchangeable glass-and-steel skylines, and when local history is fading from
                classrooms and public awareness, this documentary will explore how civic landscapes help preserve the
                character that sets cities apart,” she said. “Lincoln Park is more than recreation. It reflects loss,
                ambition, reform, and our nation’s highest level of artistic vision.”</p>

                <div class="image-caption">Sketches of monuments in Lincoln Park.</div>
            </div>

            <p>“The bronzes in Lincoln Park weren’t created simply as decoration,” Smith explained. “They show how
                earlier generations chose to remember leadership, war, loss, and civic ideals.”</p>

            <p>Phase Two will soon focus on interviews with leading historians and conservation specialists. A preview
                clip on YouTube offers an early look at some of the film’s visuals and historical themes.</p>

            <p>Smith told us more about what she has discovered about Lincoln Park.</p>

            <p>“Originally established as a public cemetery, the land was renamed during the city’s collective mourning
                following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. From that beginning, the park evolved
                into a national model of civic beauty and public access to green space as Chicago confronted disease,
                rapid population growth, and sweeping social change.”</p>

            <div class="article-image">
                <img src="grant-monument-harpers.jpg" alt="Grant Monument in Harper's Weekly">
                <div class="image-caption">The Grant Monument as depicted in Harper's Weekly.</div>
            </div>

            <p>She noted the park’s artistic legacy is equally notable. The oldest statue honors Native Americans, while
                sculptor Gutzon Borglum, later famed for Mount Rushmore, created both the Governor John Peter Altgeld
                Monument in 1915 and the General Philip Henry Sheridan Monument in 1923. “Public monument unveilings
                once drew extraordinary crowds. It’s estimated 200,000 people attended the dedication of the Ulysses S.
                Grant equestrian statue, roughly one in five Chicagoans at the time, and Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert,
                along with his namesake grandson, attended the unveiling of Augustus Saint-Gaudens’ Standing Lincoln,”
                Smith said.</p>

            <p>Yet beneath the lawns and pathways lies a sobering reality: not all of the cemetery’s original burials
                were relocated.</p>

            <p>“Other chapters unfold just as quietly, including the Civil War, the Fresh Air Sanitarium, Temperance,
                connections to the Haymarket Riot, landfill expansion that created Lake Shore Drive, and more. Together,
                they reveal Lincoln Park as a historical record hiding in plain sight beneath one of Chicago’s most
                beloved public spaces.”</p>

            <p>Smith said she visited Lincoln Park in a stroller soon after she was born and then biked through it with
                her brother as a child. As an adult, she crossed the park while commuting nearby and returned on
                weekends for long walks with her dogs.</p>

            <p>“A friend created a series of watercolors of the park’s monuments, later published in her award-winning
                book, Giants in the Park,” she said. “Her work made me slow down and notice the details around me. While
                there are many books and blogs about Lincoln Park, film allows audiences to experience these stories
                visually and emotionally. That’s when I realized I wanted to film the park thoughtfully, to put a camera
                on the experts and share the stories behind what people see every day.”</p>

            <p>One of her favorite places to pause is on a bench at the Little Cold Water Girl/Frances Willard statue
                close to the LaSalle underpass. It first appeared at the World’s Fair of 1893, erected by the Woman’s
                Christian Temperance Union to urge people to drink water, with cups attached for people and a trough for
                horses, dogs and birds. After the fair, it was moved to the Woman’s Temple in the Loop and, when that
                was to be demolished, to Lincoln Park in 1940. Although the statue was stolen, it was re-cast from the
                original mold. Smith is in discussions to interview the artist responsible for its recreation, who
                preserves bronze monuments across the city and nationwide.</p>

            <div class="article-image">

                <div class="image-caption">The Little Cold Water Girl statue close to West LaSalle Drive.</div>
            </div>

            <p>She also delights in the park’s equestrian sculptures. “I love the horses in the park, President Grant’s
                war horse Cincinnati and General Sheridan’s Winchester, renamed after one of his Civil War victories,”
                Smith said. “And it’s wonderful to see children climbing into the lap of an author’s statue in the
                English gardens. I also like to pause at the Altgeld monument, which feels almost hidden among the
                trees.”</p>

            <p>“Located on the northwest corner of Lincoln Park, the National Elks Memorial, which is celebrating its
                100th anniversary this year, has kindly agreed to serve as an in-kind sponsor by hosting the interviews
                in one of Chicago’s most architecturally significant buildings. The Memorial offers a fitting setting
                for conversations about civic memory,” Smith said.</p>

            <p>The production is proceeding with permission from the Chicago Park District, which is not a sponsor or
                producing partner of the film. Upon completion, the documentary will first be submitted to PBS for
                consideration and then made freely available online to residents, visitors, educators, and students.</p>

            <p>When asked how visitors should best experience Lincoln Park, Smith recommends taking time to explore it
                gradually. “There isn’t one perfect path,” she said. “If someone wants the full experience, I suggest a
                kind of grand tour, which can be followed with a guidebook or at your own pace: a loop that takes you
                past the park’s monuments, gardens, zoo, lagoons, and lakeshore.”</p>
